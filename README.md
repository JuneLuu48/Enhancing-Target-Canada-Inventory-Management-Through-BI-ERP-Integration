# Enhancing Target Canada Inventory Management using BI

The purpose of the proposed Business Intelligence (BI) application is to support effective inventory management and managerial decision-making by transforming ERP transactional data into real-time, actionable insights. Specifically, the BI application is designed to address the inventory management failures experienced by Target Canada by improving data accuracy, visibility, and demand forecasting capabilities.

By integrating data from ERP, POS, and warehouse management systems into a centralized data warehouse, the BI application establishes a single source of truth for inventory-related information. This enables real-time monitoring of stock levels, product movement, and delivery performance, reducing the risk of stockouts, overstocking, and data inconsistencies.

In addition, the BI application leverages advanced analytics and machine learning models to analyse historical sales patterns, regional demand trends, and seasonal variations. These capabilities allow managers to generate more accurate demand forecasts, optimise replenishment decisions, and adapt inventory strategies to local market conditions rather than relying on assumptions from external markets.

Finally, through interactive dashboards and automated alerts, the BI application enhances operational transparency and responsiveness, enabling managers to quickly identify issues, take corrective action, and make data-driven decisions. Overall, the BI application aims to create a resilient, insight-driven inventory management system that improves operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term business performance.
